## A Background on the disease

### Typhoid Fever Has the Following Symptoms
* Prolonged high fever
* Weakness
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Constipation or diarrhea
* Loss of appetite
* "Rose spots" rash

### Diagnosis, Treatment, and Vaccination
Diagnosis of the disease is established by conducting laboratory tests on blood, stool,
or urine samples. With the administration of suitable antibiotic treatment, the majority of
individuals recover from the infection without complications. However, there is a growing concern
due to certain strains of the disease that have acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics. 
To combat the disease, there are two available vaccines: the Conjugate Vaccine, which provides 70% 
effectiveness after a year of vaccination, and the Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine, which offers 
shorter-term protection, is less expensive, but does not prevent carriage of the bacteria, 
exhibiting 60% effectiveness.

### Epidemiology
Annually, there are 150 thousand deaths attributed to the disease, with the number having decreased 
from 500 thousand deaths in 2005. The infection affects a significant population, with an estimated 
10 to 20 million cases reported each year. In Israel, approximately 10 infections occur annually, 
mostly acquired during travel abroad. Geographically, the disease is prevalent in regions such as 
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, as well as Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. 
The incubation period for the disease is relatively long, with symptoms typically manifesting 
between 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to the bacteria.
