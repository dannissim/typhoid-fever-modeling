### Gram Vikas: Better Toilets, Better Life
Gram Vikas is a Indian NGO which provides villages with training to construct their own toilets, 
while requiring 100% participation. By involving every member of the village, Gram Vikas fosters a 
sense of ownership and collective responsibility for sanitation. Additionally, 
the organization uses local materials, to build sustainable and cost-effective toilets. 
In the end all of the households have completed toilets and bathing rooms.
