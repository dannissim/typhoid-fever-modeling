### Interactive App
Welcome to our interactive SIR model app! Here, you can explore and simulate the fascinating 
transmission dynamics of typhoid fever. Using sliders, you have the power to adjust various 
parameters of the model, allowing you to observe how changes in factors like transmission rate, 
recovery rate, and initial population affect the progression of the disease. DGain insights into how
infectious diseases spread and evolve over time. Have fun experimenting with different scenarios
and unraveling the complexities of typhoid fever dynamics. Enjoy!
