### Impact and Community Development
Thanks to the efforts of the Gram Vikas, significant positive changes have been achieved in the 
lives of communities they serve. Over 400,000 people now have access to private bathrooms with 
running water, which has led to an 80% reduction in water-borne diseases. In the past, women and 
their daughters used to spend an arduous 7 hours daily fetching water, resulting in only 9% of girls
being able to attend school. However, with the implementation of Gram Vikas' initiatives, the school
attendance rate for girls has skyrocketed to 90%. Moreover, through their training programs in 
masonry, plumbing, and bar bending, laborers' earning potential has increased by an impressive 300%,
empowering them to secure a better livelihood for themselves and their families. The transformative 
impact of Gram Vikas is evident in the improved health, education, and economic prospects of the 
communities they support.

## Mathematical Models of Typhoid Fever
The research article, “Predicting the Impact of Vaccination on the Transmission Dynamics of Typhoid
in South Asia: A Mathematical Modeling Study”, available 
[here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002642) which was written by professors in 
Yale, Harvard, and Oxford University, and published in the journal, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
in 2014, models transmission dynamics of Typhoid in Vellore, India, during the years 2000 - 2012.
The paper concludes that it is unlikely that Typhoid can be eliminated through vaccination alone, 
and that the effects of vaccination depend strongly on the role of chronic carriers in transmission.
