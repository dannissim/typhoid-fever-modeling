### Salmonella Characteristics
Salmonella is a type of Gram-negative bacteria with a unique cell structure that sets it apart from 
other types of bacteria. Due to this structure, it can be more challenging to treat with 
antibiotics. One notable characteristic of Salmonella is its ability to survive without oxygen, 
making it adaptable to various environments. The bacteria possesses tiny tails called flagella, 
which allow it to move and navigate within its surroundings. Notably, Salmonella can persist for 
months in stagnant water, presenting a risk for contamination. Furthermore, Salmonella exhibits the 
capability to enter and survive inside human cells, contributing to its pathogenicity. Beyond human 
hosts, this versatile bacterium can also be found in animals, potentially serving as a reservoir for
infection transmission. Understanding these features is crucial in combating Salmonella-related 
illnesses and implementing effective preventive measures.

### The Patogen: Salmonella Typhi
Salmonella Typhi, a distinct strain within the Salmonella family, exhibits a unique pattern of 
infection compared to many other salmonella strains. While various salmonella strains primarily 
cause gastrointestinal infections, Salmonella Typhi takes a more severe course, targeting the 
bloodstream and crucial organs such as the liver, spleen, and intestines. This distinctive 
pathogenicity can lead to serious systemic illness.


One remarkable aspect of Salmonella Typhi is its ability to turn some infected individuals into 
chronic carriers. Even after recovering from the acute illness, these carriers continue to harbor 
the bacterium in their bodies, often unknowingly. This poses a significant concern as chronic 
carriers can inadvertently become a source of infection for others, perpetuating the transmission 
of the pathogen.


Diagnosis plays a pivotal role in managing Salmonella Typhi infections effectively. Identifying 
the specific strain allows for targeted antibiotic treatment, which is crucial due to the strain's 
resistance patterns and the severity of the infections it causes. Swift and accurate diagnosis is 
essential in preventing further spread and managing the impact of Salmonella Typhi on public health.

### Transmission Routes and Risk Factors
The primary mode of infection is ingestion of water or food contaminated with feces or urine 
containing Salmonella Typhi. Contamination can occur because of:
* Poor sanitation
* Improper sewage disposal or hygiene infrastructure
* Unhygienic food practices
* Open defecation
* Lack of access to clean water
* Overcrowded living
* Direct person to person transmission is significantly less common.

### World Health Organization Research and Development Blueprint
Every couple of years the WHO publishes a global strategy aimed at accelerating the development of
medical products during epidemics. The blueprint focuses on prioritizing diseases and pathogens with
epidemic potential for which there are no or inadequate countermeasures. The blueprint includes 
research projects for typhoid:
* Development of new typhoid vaccines.The current vaccine, is not fully effective and can have
side effects.
* Development of new rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid. The current tests are not always accurate.
* Development of new treatments for typhoid. The current treatments for typhoid are not
always effective.

### Current WHO Priority Diseases
* COVID-19
* Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
* Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease
* Lassa fever
* Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(SARS)
* Nipah and henipaviral diseases
* Rift Valley fever
* Zika
* “Disease X” - represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a 
pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease.

### Major Sanitation Issues in India
80% of diseases in rural areas of India are because of poor quality water.
Human waste, finds its way back to drinking water, bathing water, washing water, irrigation water
In rural India, access to running water is limited, and can be far away limited, resulting in the 
need for water storage. Unfortunately, this leads to contamination. Open defecation is rampant. 
At the start of the 21st century, 70% of rural Indians defecate in the open. 
Political Issues - Social status plays a significant role in Indian policy, with the guideline that 
poor people get poor solutions, and absolutely poor people get pathetic solutions.
